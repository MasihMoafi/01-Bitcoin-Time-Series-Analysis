Apologies for misunderstanding about your breaks. I left those slots for personal time and meal, as it's generally good practice to have some time off from work. But I appreciate your commitment, and here's your revised schedule:

| Time           | Monday    | Tuesday  | Wednesday | Thursday  | Friday  | Saturday | Sunday    |
| -------------- | --------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| 10:00-10:30 AM | Wake Up/ Morning Routine | Wake Up/ Morning Routine | Wake Up/ Morning Routine | Wake Up/ Morning Routine | Wake Up/ Morning Routine | Wake Up/ Morning Routine | Wake Up/ Morning Routine |
| 10:30-01:30 PM | Programming Practice | TensorFlow Tutorials | Programming Practice | RL Tutorials | Review Notes/Questions | TensorFlow Tutorials | RL Tutorials |
| 01:30-02:00 PM | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions |
| 02:00-05:00 PM | TensorFlow Tutorials | RL Tutorials | TensorFlow Tutorials | Programming Practice | TensorFlow Tutorials | RL Tutorials | Programming Practice |
| 05:00-06:00 PM | OpenAI Chat (Brainstorming) | OpenAI Chat (Brainstorming) | OpenAI Chat (Brainstorming) | OpenAI Chat (Brainstorming) | OpenAI Chat (Brainstorming) | OpenAI Chat (Brainstorming) | OpenAI Chat (Brainstorming) |
| 06:00-07:00 PM | Programming Practice | Programming Practice | Programming Practice | Programming Practice | Programming Practice | Programming Practice | Programming Practice |
| 07:00-10:00 PM | Reading (Book/Papers) | Reading (Book/Papers) | Reading (Book/Papers) | Reading (Book/Papers) | Reading (Book/Papers) | Reading (Book/Papers) | Reading (Book/Papers) |
| 10:00-01:00 AM | TensorFlow Tutorials | RL Tutorials | TensorFlow Tutorials | Programming Practice | TensorFlow Tutorials | RL Tutorials | Programming Practice |
| 01:00-02:00 AM | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions | Review Notes/Questions |
| 02:00-10:00 AM | Sleep | Sleep | Sleep | Sleep | Sleep | Sleep | Sleep |

Now, at 2:30 pm, you can continue with TensorFlow tutorials. Let's say you spend the next 2.5 hours (until 5:00 PM) on the tutorials, then spend an hour on OpenAI Chat (brainstorming), and then get back to more programming practice or start your reading schedule.

Once again, this schedule is meant to be flexible, it can and should be adapted based on your needs and progress.
