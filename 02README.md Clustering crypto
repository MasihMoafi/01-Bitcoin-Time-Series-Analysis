Cryptocurrency Clustering using K-Means

This project demonstrates the clustering of cryptocurrencies using the K-Means algorithm. The goal is to group cryptocurrencies based on their market data attributes and visualize the clusters.
Project Structure

This project includes the code for data retrieval using coingecko's API, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization using PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Prerequisites

The following dependencies were used:

    requests
    pandas
    sklearn
    matplotlib
    seaborn

Results

The project generates a scatter plot that visualizes the clusters of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the silhouette score will be displayed as a measure of clustering quality.

Silhouette Score: 0.9137774106270407
