# Dynamic Pricing Analysis with Random Forest Regression

This project explores dynamic pricing strategies using machine learning techniques, specifically employing a Random Forest Regression model to predict ride costs based on various factors.

## Overview

The project involves:

- Data preprocessing to handle categorical variables and prepare data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Plotly to visualize relationships and distributions.
- Training a Random Forest Regression model to predict ride costs based on features like number of riders, drivers, vehicle type, and expected ride duration.
- Evaluating the model's performance and interpreting results through visualizations.

## Key Components

- **Data Preparation**: Converting categorical features, handling missing values, and detecting outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Using Plotly to create scatter plots and box plots for data visualization.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Utilizing a Random Forest Regression model and assessing its accuracy through predicted vs. actual values comparison.

## Usage

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install necessary dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Execute the main script or Jupyter notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and visualize results.
